# volumetric_scan_with_autofocus
During fast image acquisition, either 2D or 3D, users can add an offset to the focal distance values in the look-up table to deal with drift. This program monitors image qualities in the background and if the image gets blurry, it will modify the offset value and try to get images back to focus.
